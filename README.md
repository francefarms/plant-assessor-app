AI-Powered Plant Growth & Health Assessor

This project demonstrates an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered web application designed to assess plant growth and health based on image analysis. Utilizing supervised machine learning, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the system classifies plant images into categories like 'healthy' or 'unhealthy'.

Key Features/What I Learned:

Machine Learning Model Development:
Implemented and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras for image classification.
Gained practical experience with supervised learning techniques for visual data.
Understood and applied image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) and data augmentation to prepare image datasets for training.
Learned to save and load trained ML models (.h5 files) for efficient deployment.
Data Handling & Preparation:
Organized and labeled custom image datasets (e.g., 'healthy' vs. 'unhealthy' plant images).
Dealt with challenges of preparing real-world image data for machine learning.
Web Application Development:
Built a basic web interface using Flask (Python web framework) to allow users to upload images and receive predictions.
Integrated a trained machine learning model into a web application's backend.
Developed a simple frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for user interaction.
Deployment & Troubleshooting:
Gained experience with local web server deployment (Flask's development server).
Successfully version-controlled the project using Git and hosted it on GitHub.
Crucially, learned extensive debugging and troubleshooting skills by resolving various common errors (module not found, file path issues, Python syntax errors, date handling, authentication, and dependency management). This included adapting code for different environments and understanding traceback messages.
Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Flask.
